The Gobang game project is developed using the C++ programming language, with visualization capabilities enabled by the EasyX graphics library. Architecturally, it employs a two-dimensional array to store the game board state and organizes functionality into modular functions initialization, interface rendering, user interaction, and game logic. Additional features include a basic AI opponent, move undo functionality, and background music support through the Windows Multimedia API.

The development environment is Windows-based, relying on the EasyX library for graphical rendering of the game board and pieces. Compilation can be performed using C++ compilers such as Visual Studio or MinGW. The project's modular structure ensures clear separation of concerns, with each function module handling specific aspects of the game, from board initialization to victory condition checks.
